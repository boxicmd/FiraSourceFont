# FiraSourceFont
Fira Source is based on Fira Code. Stylistic sets are fixed with SS03(&amp;), SS05(@).

Fira Code is my favorite monospace font, good for programming, with clear characters.
To fix the stylistic sets, I used the scripts from Fira Source Mono, 
but customized it slightly regarding my own preference of style - SS03 and SS05.

Special thanks to the authors of:
Fira Mono (https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/);
Fira Code (https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), which is based on Fira Mono;
Fira Source Mono (https://github.com/Microflash/FiraSourceMono), which is based on Fira Code.

Thanks and enjoy!

## build.sh
To build from Fira Code, use 
($ source build.sh)

Before running the build, make sure python (version 2) is installed, and some libs are ready as well, like:
1. future
2. fonttools
3. setuptools

Use ($ python -m pip install future,fonttools,setuptools)
to install them.

Might want to use a virtualenv to install the libs.
