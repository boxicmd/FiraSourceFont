# FiraSourceFont
Fira Source is based on Fira Code. Stylistic sets are fixed with SS03(&amp;), SS05(@).

Fira Code is my favorite monospace font, good for programming, with clear characters.
To fix the stylistic sets, I used the scripts from Fira Source Mono, 
but customized it slightly regarding my own preference of style - SS03 and SS05.

Special thanks to the authors of:
Fira Mono (https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/)
Fira Code (https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), which is based on Fira Mono.
Fira Source Mono (https://github.com/Microflash/FiraSourceMono), which is based on Fira Code.

Thanks and enjoy!
